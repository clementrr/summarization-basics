US President Donald Trump is breaking precedent once again by not meeting with America's Nobel prize winners. The eight US laureates have not been scheduled to see Mr Trump ahead of their December trip to Sweden to receive their awards. However, not all of them are disappointed at the prospect of missing out on the Oval office greeting. Joachim Frank, awarded the Nobel in chemistry for work in microscopy, told Stat News that he “will not put my foot into the White House as long as Trump, Pence...occupy it.”

He also included House Speaker Paul Ryan on that list in case he ends up in the White House as a result of the “possible succession of impeachments".
