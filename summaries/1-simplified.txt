The Director of the National Science Foundation, France Cordova, will also be in attendance at the event once again. However, not all of them are disappointed at the prospect of missing out on the Oval office greeting. Former President Barack Obama met with laureates every year except in 2009, his first year in office, when he himself was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. According to Stat News, the White House cited the President’s travel schedule as the reason. Mr Frank, who said he was "relieved" at not having to turn down an invitation, noted that he does not speak for all the US winners, but said: “I strongly believe that as thinking intelligent people they will have a similar attitude as I.”

The other Americans include: physicists Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish, and Kip Thorne, geneticists Jeffrey C Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael W Young, and economist Richard Thaler.
