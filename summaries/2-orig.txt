"Rian will do amazing things with the blank canvas of this new trilogy." "Johnson will introduce new characters from a corner of the galaxy that Star Wars lore has never before explored," Disney said in a statement. The new films will be separate from the Skywalker saga. "He's a creative force, and watching him craft 'The Last Jedi' from start to finish was one of the great joys of my career," Lucasfilm's Kathleen Kennedy said of Johnson. Disney also announced a live-action "Star Wars" series that will debut on its streaming service which is set to launch in 2019.
