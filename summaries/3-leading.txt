The Quebec government is set to table legislation Thursday that will provide a framework for legalized marijuana, but details are already emerging, including the name of the organization that will handle its sale: the Société Québécoise du Cannabis. Public Health Minister Lucie Charlebois acknowledged Wednesday that the bill won't be perfect, but that it aims to address "public health and security" of the population ahead of the federal legalization of cannabis next year. Provincial legislation, she suggested, could "evolve" over time. "We have to be flexible enough to adapt as we go along because we are not naive, we know that the black market will certainly react also to what we are doing," added Finance Minister Carlos Leitao.
