"Rian will do amazing things with the blank canvas of this new trilogy." "Johnson will introduce new characters from a corner of the galaxy that Star Wars lore has never before explored," Disney said in a statement. That Johnson will preside over a new "Star Wars" trilogy altogether confirms his status as the franchise's new chief guardian. It's a considerable amount of trust to be placed in the 43-year-old director of 2012â€²s "Looper," even before audiences see his first "Star Wars" installment.
