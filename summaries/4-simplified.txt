Perhaps the most interesting thing about AlphaGo Zero, though, isn’t how fast it was able to do what it did, or with such efficacy, but also that it ultimately didn’t even achieve its full potential. DeepMind’s whole goal is to build artificial general intelligence, however, which can use its smarts to accomplish different tasks – so a smarter AlphaGo Zero might be able to better optimize energy management in Google’s data centers, for instance, or even in the electrical grid in general.
