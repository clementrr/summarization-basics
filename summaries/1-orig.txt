The Director of the National Science Foundation, France Cordova, will also be in attendance at the event once again. US President Donald Trump is breaking precedent once again by not meeting with America's Nobel prize winners. In his place, the White House’s Office of Technology Policy’s Michael Kratsios will attend the Swedish Embassy’s Nobel prize reception on behalf of the administration. Mr Trump may not want to deal with the political platform often used by laureates when given an audience with the President. Former President Barack Obama met with laureates every year except in 2009, his first year in office, when he himself was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
